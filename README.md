## Project Charter 

### Vision

The product is a web APP which provides a transparent and accurate tool for virtual soccer teams founders in any soccer video game to predict overall scores of players in their teams, as well as to find players right for their teams.

### Mission

- Accuracy

  The product enables users to predict overall scores for players in their teams based on combinations on different input attributes, which includes: age, weight, strength, stamina, etc.

  According to the predicted score, the product produces recommendations of players different positions to users.

- Transparency

  Users are available to monitor the process of when using the product

### Success criteria 

**ML Metric**: 

- Predict player scores with Mean Squared Error of  lower than 10. 

**Business Metric**: 

- 80% of users select recommended players as members of their teams.

- $100,000 of yearly revenue generated by payed service and advertisements.

- 3000 active users after first year run of the product

- 0.8 Click Through Rate for users who open the APP

### Project Timeline

**Week 1-2: Data Processing**

- Exploratory Data Analysis

  * Data Overview

    The dataset contains information on over 18,000 players.

    + Descriptive Statistics
    + Skewness
    + Influential Observations

  * Data Cleaning
      
      + NAs Removing
      + Duplicates Removing
      + Outliers Removing

- Model Building

  Train multiple models to predict scores of players, including both linear and non-linear models. 
  
  * Linear Regression
  * Neural Network
  * Random Forest
  * Decision Tree
  
  MSE is the measurement for model performance. The model with the lowest MSE will be selected as the final model deployed in the product.

**Week 3-8: APP Building**

Building pipelines and web APP.

**Week 9-10**

Test web APP, optimize user interfaces and write the final report.
