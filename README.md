## Project Charter 

### Vision

The project provides a tool for virtual soccer teams founders to estimate scores of players in their teams, as well as to find players right for their teams.

### Mission

- The product enables users to predict overall scores for players in their teams based on combinations on different input attributes, which includes: age, weight, strength, stamina, etc.

- The project produces recommendations of players with predicted scores according to different positions.

### Success criteria 

**ML Metric**: 

- Predict player scores with Mean Squared Error of  lower than 10. 

**Business Metric**: 

- Over 80% of users select recommended players as members of their teams.

- No less than $100,000 of yearly revenue generated by payed service and advertisements.
